        Potential fields based implementation for online obstacle avoidance using
        DMP framework

        This library only includes the potential gradient term as described in [1].
        The forcing function term is omitted. Hence, no training is required for DMP.

        For a more complete DMP implementation (having forcing terms), refer [2]
